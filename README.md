## Yatzy in React-Native
[Yatzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy) is a dice game similar to Yacht and Yahtzee. The players roll dices and after each roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn. The player must put a score or zero into a score box each turn. The game ends when all score boxes are used. If the player has reached a Total of 63 points, he will receive a bonus. IN our application this is a single-player game, that can be run in the web, IOS or android, but only tested for the web and IOS application. The utilization was built using [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev ).
